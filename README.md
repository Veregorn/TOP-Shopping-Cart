# Shopping Cart

This is a 2-pages shopping cart App (a home page and a shop page, which includes a shopping cart) coded in Javascript and React. Tests are created in Vitest.

The idea is to practice with React Components, going trough TDD and proving myself I can implement React Routing and API calls.

The user can navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both pages.

Shop items are fetched from FakeStore API (https://fakestoreapi.com/)
